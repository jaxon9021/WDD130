            <h2>Fashion to Me</h2>
            <p>Fashion is one of my favorite things. To me fashion is more than just extravagant clothes, fashion is an art form. Many people misunderstand fashion and use the word to stand for trends and fads however fashion is more than that. Fashion is a form of self-expression and a way for a designer or wearer to display themselves through the clothes they are wearing and or making. Ever since I was young I have been into weird and interesting clothes. When I could walk and talk I would not let my mother dress me because "The clothes she picked were ugly.". During elementary school I would wear colored skinny jeans and button-up shirts, this was how I expressed myself throughout my childhood. As I got older these things stayed the same, some people saw what I would wear and always had something to say, but I never cared because this was who I was and how I expressed myself. As I got older it turned from just wearing clothes to learning about them and their history. This is why my website includes two of the most well-known fashion designers. There is more to fashion than just wearing what is trendy and these designers help to show that. </p>
