        [Rei Kawakubo is a Japanese designeer born on October 11 1942. Rei started off working in advertising for a textile company and would design and make pieces using the textiles to showcase them to consumers. People began asking her to make them pieces and she quickly grew fond of the clothing making business. She then moved on to becoming a full time stylist however the pieces she was given did not always ft her creative idea so she would request changes and ended up furthering into putting the models into her own designs. Rei began her own label called Comme Des Garcons in 1969, Comme Des Garcon roughly translates to like the boys in French. Rei started as a very plain designer when it came to colors utilizing mostly black. This was until she hired on a young designer by the name of Junya Watanabe, he brought into the scene loud ccolors and patterns mostly known for their polca dot pattern. Now CDG is one of the most well known fashion brands in the whole world, with all of their side projects and non runway pieces even people not into fashion can recognize the heart logo of CDG Play. CDG play has done many collabs with mainstream brands notably being converse where they put there heart logo on to the classic chuck 70. Even if you do not know CDG you know CDG.]
